# Wireframing

## Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or mobile app. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality without getting into the details of design elements like colors, fonts, or images. 

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarity of Ideas:** Wireframes help in communicating ideas clearly and ensure that stakeholders, designers, and developers are aligned on the project vision.  
- **Focus on Functionality:** They allow teams to focus on user experience (UX) and functionality before investing time in visual design.  
- **Quick Iterations:** Since wireframes are low-fidelity, they can be easily revised and adjusted to reflect feedback.  
- **Cost-Effective:** Catching design or usability issues at the wireframe stage is cheaper than correcting them later in development.  
- **Foundation for Design:** Wireframes act as a blueprint for UI design and development, guiding the placement of elements and navigation flow.
